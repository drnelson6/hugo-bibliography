# Hugo Bibliography

Hugo Bibliography is a Hugo Module designed to help you fetch and format bibliography data. This module comes with scripts and shortcodes you can seamlessly integrate into your project to quickly add an in-text citation or Bibliography page to your static site. 

## Adding a Bibliography

By default, hugo-bibliography fetches bibliography data from a Zotero group. The fetching of bibliography data is now handled entirely within the hugo build process.

To fetch bibliography data from a Zotero group, you will need to configure your Zotero Group ID inside of your hugo's hugo.toml/hugo.yaml file.

Here is an example of how to configure your Zotero Group ID in a toml file:

```
params = { groupId = 1196 }
```


## Features

All of the shortcodes rely on data fetched from Zotero based on the Zotero Group ID configured in your hugo.toml/hugo.yaml file.

#### Bibliography

To add a full bibliography, call the bibliography shortcode with the following:

`{{<bibliography>}}`

To include collections after the full bibliography, you must explicitly pass the parameter `collections`:

`{{<bibliography collections=true>}}`

#### Filtering

You can add a parameter to limit the scope of the bibliography.

`{{<bibliography itemType="journalArticle">}}`

The above shortcode will now only render entries of the bibliography that includes a key of "itemType" with the corresponding value of "journalArticle."

The value does not have to be an exact match to the key so long as the value is a substring of the key.

This filtering also works to specify specific collections or subcollections to generate a bibliography for.

#### Taxonomy/Tags

With the current version of hugo-bibliography, you can rig together a taxonomy by making markdown files that each dsiplay the bibliography for a specific tag.

```
/content/bibliography/tag-1.md
/content/bibliography/tag-2.md
/content/bibliography/tag-3.md
```

Then, you can add a shortcode to your markdown files to display the bibliography for a specific tag.

```
---
title: "Bibliography for Tag 1"
---

  {{<bibliography keyword="tag-1">}}
```

Using the keyword parameter, you can filter the bibliography to only include entries that have a keyword that matches the tag.

A solution to automatically generating tags for a bibliography without having to make every markdown file manually is in the works.
If instead of filtering by a specific key-value pair, you would like to filter by a value that exists anywhere in an entry, you can use the following syntax:

`{{<bibliography keyword="some keyword">}}`

Now, the bibliography will only include entries that have the keyword "some keyword" in any of the values of the entry. This property is particularly useful for generating bibliographies for particular authors, editors or projects.

#### Cite

To add an in-text citation, use the cite shortcode and specify the title of the work you want to cite. 

`{{<cite title="Title Of Work">}}`

You can generate a bibliography of only the works that have been cited on a given page using the following:

`{{<bibliography cited="true">}}`

You can also generate a bibliography of the works that have been cited throughout your entire site using the following:

`{{<works-cited>}}`

Note that this feature requires site.Store which is only available in hugo 0.138.0 and above.


#### Zotero detection

By default, hugo-bibliography includes COinS data to its bibliography shortcode. If you're using Zotero Connector, you should be able to save any and all of the bibliography citations into Zotero.

## Installation

To use Hugo-bibliography, simply add the module as a theme in your hugo project.

`git submodule add https://github.com/dh-tech/hugo-bibliography.git themes/hugo-bibliography`

Then add the theme in your hugo.toml file.

`theme = ['hugo-bibliography']`

## Customization

Hugo-Bibliography can be customized in a few ways. The styling for the bibliography shortcode is contained within the bibliography shortcode's html file or /themes/hugo-bibliography/layouts/shortcodes/bibliography.html.

You will notice the styling used for the apa-citation is contained at the top of the file. If you would like to change the bibliography's style (eg. type-face, font-size, padding) you can add your own style rules here. Note that the italics is done through i tags instead of style rules.

As for changing the citation style itself, this can be done by modifying the layouts/partials/render/render-citation.html file for bibliography citations or layouts/shortcodes/cite.html for in-text citations.
